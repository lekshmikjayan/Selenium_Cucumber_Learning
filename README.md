# Selenium_Cucumber_Learning

Behavior-driven development and automated testing of web applications by leveraging Gherkin syntax for test scenarios and Selenium WebDriver for interacting with web elements.

## IMPORTANT FEATURES

Gherkin Syntax: 
   * Gherkin provides a structured language for describing test scenarios using keywords such as Given, When, Then, And, and But. 
   * This syntax makes test scenarios easily understandable by both technical and non-technical team members, facilitating clear and concise test case documentation.
    
Reusability: 
   * Cucumber encourages reusability by promoting the creation of reusable step definitions and page objects. 
   * Step definitions encapsulate test actions, making them reusable across multiple scenarios. 
   * Page objects centralize the interactions with web elements, making tests more maintainable and reducing duplication.
    
Feature Files: 
   * They typically contain scenarios with steps that describe user interactions and expected outcomes. 
   * Feature files serve as documentation and executable tests.
    
Scenario Outlines: 
   * They allow the same scenario to be executed with different sets of inputs, reducing duplication and improving test coverage.

Step Definitions: 
   * Step definitions are the glue code that maps the steps written in Gherkin syntax to actual code implementations.
   * In Selenium with Cucumber, step definitions typically interact with the web elements on the page, perform assertions, and call the appropriate Selenium methods.
    
Background: 
   * The Background keyword allows the definition of common preconditions that apply to all scenarios within a feature.
   * It helps in reducing repetitive steps and ensures a consistent starting point for scenarios.

Cross-Browser Testing: 
   * Selenium with Cucumber enables cross-browser testing by allowing tests to be executed across multiple web browsers, ensuring compatibility and consistent behavior across different environments.
    
Test Reports and Logging: 
   * Cucumber provides built-in reporting capabilities, generating human-readable reports that summarize test execution results. 
   * These reports include information on the passed and failed scenarios, helping in identifying issues and tracking the overall test progress.
   * Additionally, logging mechanisms can be implemented to capture detailed information during test execution.
